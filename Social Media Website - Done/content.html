						<h3>CNBC - Crypto exchange Binance will suspend U.S. dollar transfers</h3>
						<p>PUBLISHED MON, FEB 6 2023 2:06 PM EST | UPDATED TUE, FEB 7 2023 6:18 PM EST</p>
						<p>Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, will suspend U.S. dollar deposits and withdrawals, the company said Monday, without providing a reason for the decision.

							“We are temporarily suspending USD bank transfers as of February 8th,” a Binance spokesperson told CNBC. “Affected customers are being notified directly.” The company said “0.01% of our monthly active users leverage USD bank transfers” and added that “we are working hard to restart service as soon as possible.”</p>
						<P>Binance US, a unit of the company that’s regulated by the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, said in a tweet that it’s not affected by the suspension. Thus the move applies only to non-U.S. customers who transfer money to or from bank accounts in dollars.

							Data from Arkham Intelligence shows that following the announcement, there was a sharp spike in outflows from Binance’s crypto wallets, as millions of dollar-pegged stablecoins such as tether
							 and USDC
							 flowed to rival exchanges or individual wallets.</P>
							 <P>Binance’s net U.S. dollar outflow was over $172 million for the day, based on data from DefiLlama. That represents a tiny amount of money for a company that has $42.2 billion worth of crypto assets, according to Arkham.

								“We’re still overwhelmingly net-positive on net deposits,” the spokesperson said. “Outflows always tick up when prices start to level off following a bullish market swing like we saw last week as some users take profits.” Bitcoin
								 rose more than 38% in January, its best month since October 2021.
								
								Binance’s exchange token, BNB
								, was largely unaffected by the news, holding steady at around $328.</P>
								<P>In late January, Binance said U.S. banking partner Signature Bank
									had increased U.S. dollar transaction minimums to $100,000. At the time, Binance said Signature had told the exchange that the new minimum applied to all crypto exchange customers.
								   
								   Regarding Monday’s suspension, a Binance representative told CNBC in an email that “Binance.US has its own banking partners and does not have any issues.” The main Binance exchange does not serve U.S. users.
								   
								   Binance said customers can still use other fiat currencies or payment methods to purchase crypto. For the small number affected, “we’ll have a new partner to announce for those users in the next couple weeks,” the spokesperson said.</P>
								   <P>CNBC’s Kate Rooney contributed to this report.</P>

						<h3>CNBC - Bitcoin rises despite U.S. crackdown, as crypto market gains $84 billion in value</h3>
						<P>PUBLISHED THU, FEB 16 2023 3:39 AM EST | UPDATED FRI, FEB 17 2023 3:18 AM EST</P>
						<p>Crypto markets rose on Thursday, shrugging off a tougher regulatory stance from the U.S. government.

							Bitcoin
							 gained 2.06% to $24,500.00 at around 4:04 p.m. ET while ether
							 was up 1.21% at $1,679.31, according to Coin Metrics.
							
							
							There are ” increasing signs that the market bottomed last November and has turned bullish,” Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC.
							
							“We are gaining in momentum here and any bad news is being shrugged off, typical signs that the market believes the worst is over.”
							Crypto markets were on edge earlier this week following increased regulatory scrutiny from U.S. authorities on digital currencies.

							On Monday, the New York State Department of Financial Services told Paxos to stop minting new Binance USD, or BUSD, stablecoins. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a real-world asset and some are backed by assets such as bonds or cash. BUSD is pegged one-to-one to the U.S. dollar.
							
							Paxos also confirmed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has notified the company that the agency could recommend an action that alleges BUSD is a security. The SEC has not yet formally levelled any charges against Paxos.</p>
						<P>Flows into bitcoin</P>
						<P>Bitcoin’s price on Thursday sat at its highest level since mid-August 2022. Last year, nearly $1.4 trillion was wiped off the crypto market after turmoil which saw bankruptcies, failures of projects and companies. All that was topped off by the collapse of major exchange FTX.
							Yuya Hasegawa, an analyst at Japanese crypto firm Bitbank, said there is a shift from so-called altcoins, or alternative coins, to bitcoin in the wake of the regulatory action.
							“Wednesday’s crypto rally was a bit of a surprise but one thing stood out: it was led by bitcoin,” Hasegawa told CNBC.
							“The current regulatory environment surely looks like a headwind for the crypto market, but it seems like some money is moving from altcoins to bitcoin, since bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that is labeled ‘commodity’ by the SEC chair. Consequently, bitcoin’s market dominance is on the rise.”
							Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, reiterated last year that the agency views bitcoin as a commodity rather than a security. Commodities are assets like gold whereas stocks are considered securities. They are regulated differently.
							Rising interest rates from the Federal Reserve designed to fight inflation also weighed on crypto markets. Bitcoin is also closely correlated to equity markets and in particular the tech-heavy Nasdaq index. The Nasdaq is up about 16% year-to-date. Bitcoin has outperformed the index and is up 49% this year.
							Bullish sentiment in risk assets has been aided by a view that the economic downturn might not be as bad as expected, and the Fed might slow down the pace of interest rate hikes.
							“In general, the markets like the fact that inflation is coming down, interest rate hikes are slated to ease from here, but also that we may end up with either no big recession or something very mild,” Ayyar said.</P>

						<h3>What is Cryptocurrency?</h3>
						<p style="margin-top: 10px;">Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that uses encryption techniques to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank. Cryptocurrency is decentralized, meaning it is not controlled by any government or financial institution.
							Cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger that records and verifies transactions. Each block in the blockchain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, linking them together in a chain. This makes it difficult to alter past transactions and ensures the security and immutability of the ledger.
							Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was created in 2009 by an unknown individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, thousands of cryptocurrencies have been created, each with its own unique features and purposes. Some popular cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.</p>

						<h3>Investing or Trading?</h3>
						<p style="margin-top: 10px;">Investing and trading are two different approaches to cryptocurrency. Investing involves buying and holding a cryptocurrency for a longer period of time, with the expectation that it will increase in value over time. Trading, on the other hand, involves buying and selling cryptocurrencies frequently to take advantage of short-term price fluctuations.
							Investing in cryptocurrency can be a good option for those who believe in the long-term potential of a particular cryptocurrency or the technology behind it. It requires patience and a long-term mindset, as prices can be volatile in the short-term. Investors typically hold their cryptocurrency for several months or even years, waiting for it to increase in value.
							Trading cryptocurrency can be a more active approach to the market, as traders aim to profit from short-term price movements. Traders use technical analysis and other strategies to predict price movements and make trades accordingly. Trading requires a higher level of skill and knowledge, as well as a willingness to take on more risk.
							Both investing and trading can be profitable in the cryptocurrency market, but they require different approaches and strategies. It is important to understand the risks and rewards of both approaches and choose the one that best suits your goals and risk tolerance.</p>

							<h2>Replying to @Jonathan Kevin Lo - Thoughts on Bitcoin</h2>
							<p>In my opinion, Bitcoin is the best alternative asset class for investing right now. Based on data, it's constantly beat every global index market return. Unlike FIAT money, the supply of Bitcoins are limited. It only has a maximum supply of 21 million coins.   </p>
